/**
 * @fileoverview Who may READ and who may MANAGE a space RECORD.
 *
 * This is about the spaces.json entry itself — its name, brand, filing root and
 * path curation — not about the documents inside it (that is spaceVisibility.js)
 * and not about writing template files (that is wiki/components/spacePermissions.js).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The datasources spaces routes decided authority inline, from
 * two facts that are both empty in a real install:
 *
 *   const userRole = securityManager?.getUserRole(userEmail) || 'user';
 *   const isAdmin  = userRole === 'admin';
 *   const isCreator = space.createdBy === userId;
 *
 * `getUserRole` answers from `<APP_BASE_DIR>/data/security/admins.json`, a list
 * nothing populates — it is `[]` on this install, so `isAdmin` was false for
 * EVERY user including real administrators. And `createdBy` is the literal
 * string "system" on every space (spaces.json ships that way), so `isCreator`
 * was false for everyone too. The result: the whole Spaces admin UI answered
 * 403 to everybody, with "Access denied" and no indication of why.
 *
 * Meanwhile the wiki had already solved this. `wiki/components/spacePermissions.js`
 * says it outright — "the space schema has no per-space admin roster
 * (`createdBy` is typically the literal 'system'), so 'is this user an admin of
 * this space?' is *computed*" — and it computes it from the user record's own
 * `roles` array, which IS populated (`roles: ['admin']`). So the platform had
 * two parallel role systems and the datasources routes consulted the empty one.
 *
 * This module is the shared rule. It lives under shared/spaces (beside
 * contentRoot.js and spaceVisibility.js) rather than under wiki/, because the
 * datasources module must not reach into wiki internals.
 *
 * IDENTITY IS CHECKED AS A SET, NOT A SINGLE VALUE. The routes used
 * `req.user?.id || req.user?.email` and compared that ONE value against
 * `allowedUsers`, which holds EMAILS — so whenever a user record had an `id`,
 * the email list could never match and membership silently failed. Every check
 * here compares against every identity the user has.
