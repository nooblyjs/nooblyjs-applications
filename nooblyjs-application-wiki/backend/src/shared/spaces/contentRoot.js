/**
 * @fileoverview A space's CONTENT ROOT — the directory its documents live in.
 *
 * A space is a LENS over a directory, not an owner of one. Four of this
 * install's spaces (Engineering, Financial Services, People, Retail) are all
 * rooted at `knowledge-content/engineering` and differ only in the
 * `allowedPaths`/`excludedPaths` slice they show (see spaceVisibility.js). So
 * "which space is this document in?" has no single answer — but "which
 * directory did it come from?" always does, and that is what identifies content.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS ITS OWN MODULE. The same normalisation was written out
 * three times — `documentService._contentRoot`, `searchIndexer._contentRootKey`
 * and, once the search scoping below was fixed, the search route — and all
 * three must agree or the disagreement is silent. The search route decides
 * which hits belong to the requested space, and the indexer decides which space
 * NAME gets stamped on those hits at index time: if their idea of "same root"
 * ever differs by a trailing slash or a letter case, the route filters out
 * everything the indexer wrote and the space looks empty.
 *
 * That failure was live: `?spaceId=1` (Engineering Space) matched nothing,
 * because the indexer walks each content root ONCE and stamps every document
 * with the LAST space on that root — Retail — while the route kept only hits
 * stamped with the requested space's own name. Three of the four spaces
 * therefore returned zero results for every query. Scoping by root instead of
 * by name is what makes one index serve every lens on it.
