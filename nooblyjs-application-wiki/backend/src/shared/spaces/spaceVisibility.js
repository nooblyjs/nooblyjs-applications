/**
 * @fileoverview Per-space path visibility (allowedPaths / excludedPaths)
 *
 * A space can expose a CURATED SUBSET of its content root instead of all of it.
 * Two spaces may point at the same `baseDir` and show different slices — which
 * is exactly the Retail/Engineering arrangement: both are rooted at
 * `knowledge-content/engineering`, but Retail shows only three subtrees.
 *
 * The rules live on the space record, under `configuration`:
 *
 *   "allowedPaths":  ["Solution Design/Distribution", "Standards"]
 *   "excludedPaths": ["Solution Design/Distribution/Technology"]
 *
 * MATCHING IS PREFIX / SUBTREE, NOT GLOB. An entry names the ROOT of a subtree
 * and covers everything beneath it. `Standards`, `Standards/` and `Standards/*`
 * are the same rule — the trailing `/*` and `/**` are tolerated and stripped so
 * hand-written config behaves the way it reads. There is deliberately no
 * mid-path wildcard: these lists are curated by hand and a rule that quietly
 * matches more than it appears to is the wrong failure mode for an access
 * boundary. Comparison is case-insensitive (the content lives on Windows).
 *
 * The four rules, in order:
 *
 *   1. excludedPaths WINS. Anything at or below an excluded root is hidden,
 *      even inside an allowed subtree — that is the whole point of the pair
 *      (allow `Distribution`, carve out `Distribution/Technology`).
 *   2. No allowedPaths (absent or empty) = the space is UNRESTRICTED; only the
 *      exclusions apply.
 *   3. With allowedPaths, a path is visible only at or below an allowed root.
 *   4. An ANCESTOR of an allowed root survives as a PASS-THROUGH CONTAINER: the
 *      `Solution Design` folder appears in the nav purely so you can drill into
 *      `Distribution`, but its own files and its other children do not.
 *      A container with nothing left under it is dropped entirely.
 *
 * TWO EXEMPTIONS, both load-bearing:
 *
 *   - ROOT-LEVEL FILES are always visible. `home.md` / `.home.md` is the space
 *     landing page; hiding it behind an allowedPaths list would blank the home
 *     screen of every filtered space. Root-level FOLDERS get no such pass —
 *     they go through the rules like anything else.
 *   - DOT-SEGMENT PATHS resolve to their nearest visible ancestor rather than
 *     being judged on their own. `<folder>/.system/context/x.md` is plumbing
 *     for `<folder>`, so it inherits that folder's verdict. Judging it directly
 *     would fail (a `.system` path matches no rule) and break templates,
 *     context sidecars and office-document originals. Note this deliberately
 *     does NOT open a back door: `Business Processes/.system/originals/x.docx`
 *     resolves to `Business Processes`, which stays hidden.
 *
 * The compiled matcher is a pure function of the SPACE, never of the user, so
 * results stay cacheable per space — both the folder-tree ETag cache (keyed by
 * spaceId) and the search response cache (keyed by query string, which carries
 * spaceId) remain correct. Introducing a per-user rule would break both.
