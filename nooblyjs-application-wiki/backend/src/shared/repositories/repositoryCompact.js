/**
 * @fileoverview Shrink a git-backed filer's local clone by dropping history.
 *
 * WHY THESE REPOSITORIES GROW. They are committed on a timer, and what they hold
 * is machine-written: workflow-rendered landscape documents and regenerated
 * `.system/` artifacts. Measured on the live content roots, roughly half of every
 * large clone is history rather than current content — and not because of commit
 * COUNT. engineering-process reached 339MB of `.git` in SIX commits. The cause is
 * what a commit stores: the biggest documents are markdown files whose entire
 * body is one multi-megabyte line of base64 PNG. Base64 is a delta compressor's
 * worst case, so every re-render of a diagram writes a fresh ~4MB blob rather
 * than a diff, and the history accumulates copies of images nobody will read
 * again.
 *
 * WHY SHALLOW RATHER THAN A REWRITE. Squashing history and force-pushing would
 * shrink the REMOTE too, but it rewrites history other clones share, may be
 * refused by branch protection, and is unrecoverable if it goes wrong. Shallowing
 * touches only this host: `git fetch --depth=N` moves the local horizon up,
 * `reflog expire` drops the refs still pinning what fell below it, and `gc
 * --prune=now` deletes the now-unreachable objects. The remote keeps its full
 * history, no other clone notices, and the whole thing reverses with `git fetch
 * --unshallow`. Verified end to end before this module was written: a shallowed
 * clone still commits and pushes normally, and the remote's history stays intact.
 *
 * WHY DEPTH 1 IS THE DEFAULT. It reclaims the most, and it costs this platform
 * nothing it was not already giving up: the provider's own conflict strategy
 * resets --hard to origin once local divergence passes `conflictThreshold`, so
 * local history is ALREADY treated as disposable. Raise `depth` per repository
 * when someone needs to read recent commits on the host, remembering that each
 * retained auto-commit of a base64 document costs about the size of the image.
 *
 * IT IS RE-RUNNABLE, AND MEANT TO BE. Shallowing does not stop the repository
 * growing again — hourly commits pile up above the horizon just as before. Each
 * run moves the horizon back to the tip and reclaims whatever accumulated since,
 * so this is a maintenance operation, not a one-time migration. Unlike a
 * force-push rewrite it is safe to repeat and safe to schedule.
 *
 * PRECONDITIONS. The branch must be level with its remote. Unpushed commits
 * (`ahead > 0`) are refused because shallowing plus `gc` around work that exists
 * nowhere else is the one way this operation can lose data — sync first, and the
 * commits are safe on the remote. `behind > 0` is refused because the horizon
 * would be set from a tip this clone has not caught up to. A DIRTY working tree
 * is fine and deliberately allowed: these repositories almost always hold changes
 * waiting for the next auto-commit, and neither fetch nor gc touches the working
 * tree.
 *
 * Runs under the same exclusion, timer pause and lock recovery as a manual sync —
 * `gc` repacks the object store a commit would be writing into.
