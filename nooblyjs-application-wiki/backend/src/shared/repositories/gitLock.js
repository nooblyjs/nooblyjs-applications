/**
 * @fileoverview Recovery from a leftover git `*.lock` file.
 *
 * WHAT BREAKS. git takes an exclusive lock (`.git/index.lock`, `.git/HEAD.lock`,
 * `.git/refs/heads/<branch>.lock`) around anything that rewrites the index or a
 * ref, and removes it on exit. A process that is KILLED mid-operation never gets
 * to remove it, and the lock then blocks that repository forever:
 *
 *   fatal: Unable to create '<repo>/.git/index.lock': File exists.
 *
 * On this platform the usual cause is a backend restart (a deployment) landing on
 * top of an in-flight auto-commit. That would be a minor annoyance except for how
 * it FAILS: core's `autoCommitAndPush` swallows every error — "Do not rethrow —
 * periodic timers must not crash the app" — so from the moment the lock appears,
 * every hourly auto-commit dies against it in silence. The repository quietly
 * stops syncing and the analytics screen goes on showing auto-commit "On". The
 * first honest report comes from the manual sync button, possibly days later.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES, in escalating order, and only ever in reaction to git actually
 * refusing:
 *
 *   1. WAIT. A lock held by a live process is not an error, it is a queue. Poll
 *      until it disappears (default 15s) and retry.
 *   2. REMOVE, but only a lock that is provably STALE: untouched for
 *      `staleMs` (default 60s). git updates the lock's mtime as it writes the new
 *      index into it, so a full minute without a single write means no process is
 *      writing. A fresh lock is left alone and the caller is told a real git
 *      process is running.
 *   3. Give up with git's own message plus which file is holding it.
 *
 * THE PATH IS TAKEN FROM GIT'S ERROR, NOT GUESSED. `Unable to create '<path>'`
 * names the exact file, so recovery never has to assume it was `index.lock` —
 * a ref lock is handled by the same code. Before unlinking, the path is checked
 * to be inside THIS repository's `.git` directory and to end in `.lock`; anything
 * else is refused, so a malformed or hostile message cannot direct a delete
 * elsewhere.
 *
 * RESIDUAL RISK, stated plainly: "no write for 60s" infers that no process holds
 * the lock; it does not prove it. A git command that locks, then blocks for over
 * a minute before writing — a very slow pre-commit hook, an ENOSPC stall — would
 * be misread as dead, and removing its lock could corrupt the operation it was
 * part of. Callers reduce this by stopping their own auto-sync timers first (see
 * repositorySync.performSync), so the only candidate is an external process.
 * Tune with `REPO_SYNC_LOCK_STALE_MS`; raise it if this repository runs slow
 * hooks.
