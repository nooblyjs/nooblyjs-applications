/**
 * @fileoverview On-demand (UI-triggered) synchronisation of a git-backed filer.
 *
 * The repositories registered by repositoryManager.js sync on TIMERS — whichever
 * of `synchronization.fetch` / `synchronization.commit` is true, every
 * `synchronization.interval` seconds. This module is the manual equivalent behind
 * the Repository analytics screen's sync button: run the SAME operations, now,
 * for whichever direction the repository is actually configured for. A repository
 * configured only to fetch fetches; one configured only to commit commits and
 * pushes; one configured for both does both.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT JUST `provider.autoCommitAndPush()`. That is the core method the
 * commit timer calls, and its catch block ends with
 *   `// Do not rethrow — periodic timers must not crash the app`
 * so it swallows every failure and returns undefined either way. Correct for a
 * timer; wrong for a button. A rejected push (expired Bitbucket token, protected
 * branch, no upstream) would leave the screen reporting a successful sync while
 * nothing ever left the machine. The commit path is therefore composed here from
 * the provider's own primitives and EVERY error propagates to the caller.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences from the timer, both in the user's favour:
 *
 *   1. Nothing to commit but `ahead > 0` still PUSHES. `autoCommitAndPush` returns
 *      early on a clean tree, so a commit whose push failed once sits unpushed
 *      until something dirties the tree again — which on a read-mostly knowledge
 *      repository can be days.
 *   2. Commit+push runs BEFORE fetch. `provider.fetch()` pulls when behind, and
 *      `_pullWithConflictResolution` resets --hard to origin/<branch> once the
 *      local dirty count reaches `conflictThreshold`. Committing and pushing
 *      first means there is no uncommitted work left for that safety valve to
 *      discard.
 *
 * ONE SYNC PER REPOSITORY AT A TIME, AGAINST BOTH RIVALS. Two `git add -A` →
 * commit → push sequences interleaved in one working tree produce commits neither
 * caller asked for — and git enforces this itself with `.git/index.lock`, so the
 * loser does not merely misbehave, it fails outright with "Unable to create
 * '…/index.lock': File exists".
 *
 *   - Against another CLICK, and against a history compaction (repositoryCompact
 *     repacks the object store a commit writes into): `runExclusive` refuses the
 *     second with `code: 'REPOSITORY_BUSY'` rather than queueing it, because
 *     "your click did nothing yet" is a worse answer than "one is already
 *     running".
 *   - Against this repository's own AUTO TIMERS: they are stopped for the
 *     duration and restarted after (`pauseAutoSync`). Note this narrows the race
 *     without closing it — `clearInterval` does not cancel a timer callback that
 *     is already executing.
 *   - Against anything else, including a lock left behind by a git process that
 *     was KILLED (a deployment landing on an auto-commit): every action runs
 *     through `withLockRecovery`, which waits for a live lock and removes a
 *     provably abandoned one. See gitLock.js — that leftover lock is the failure
 *     that silently stops a repository syncing, because the auto-commit timer
 *     swallows the error it raises every hour thereafter.
 *
 * Reaching `filer.provider.git` (the simple-git handle) is the one piece of core
 * internals this module touches: the public FilingService surface exposes
 * `fetch()`, `push()` and `commitWithMessage(commitId, …)` — the last of which
 * only settles a queued CommitQueue entry — but nothing that stages an arbitrary
 * working tree. `push()` IS used through the wrapper so core's
 * rejected/non-fast-forward retry is preserved.
