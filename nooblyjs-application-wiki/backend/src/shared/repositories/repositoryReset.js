/**
 * @fileoverview Discard this host's local state and match the remote exactly.
 *
 *   git fetch origin <branch>
 *   git reset --hard origin/<branch>
 *   git clean -fd
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. A content repository on this platform is written by machines —
 * workflow renderers, `.system/` artifact generators, the auto-commit timer — and
 * when one of those goes wrong it goes wrong at scale: a few thousand rewritten
 * documents, a half-finished conversion run, a merge the provider's conflict
 * strategy resolved in the unwanted direction. The clone is a CACHE of the remote,
 * not a place work is authored, so the cheapest repair is to throw the local copy
 * away and take the remote's version. That is what Sync cannot do: `fetch()` pulls
 * and MERGES, so a diverged or dirty tree stays diverged.
 *
 * WHAT IT DESTROYS, stated plainly, because nothing here can be undone from the UI:
 *   - every uncommitted change to a tracked file (`reset --hard`),
 *   - every LOCAL COMMIT the remote does not have — including ones the auto-commit
 *     timer made and could not push,
 *   - every untracked file and folder (`clean -fd`).
 * Only `.gitignore`d files survive, because `clean` is run WITHOUT `-x`: on these
 * hosts that is what keeps a local `.env`, editor state and any node_modules under
 * a content root out of the blast radius. `-x` would take them too and there is no
 * reason to.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH: the remote. There is no push, no force-push, no history
 * rewrite — nothing another clone can notice. That asymmetry is the whole safety
 * argument for offering this as a button at all, and it is why a reset needs no
 * coordination with anyone else, unlike the rewrite it superficially resembles.
 *
 * RECOVERY, such as it is. `reset --hard` leaves the discarded tip in the reflog,
 * so a local commit is recoverable with `git reflog` on the host until something
 * expires it — and `repositoryCompact` expires it deliberately (`reflog expire
 * --expire=now`). Uncommitted and untracked content is simply gone. So the discarded
 * commits are LOGGED with their subjects before the reset runs; that log line is
 * frequently the only surviving record of what was thrown away.
 *
 * WHY IT REPORTS WHAT IT DISCARDED, rather than just succeeding. "Reset" that says
 * nothing is indistinguishable from "reset" that silently ate three days of an
 * auto-commit backlog because a push had been failing on an expired token. The
 * result carries the commit subjects, the changed-file count and the removed paths
 * so the screen can say what it actually cost.
 *
 * THE CONFIGURED BRANCH IS THE TARGET, not whatever happens to be checked out. If
 * the clone has drifted onto another branch or a detached HEAD, `reset --hard` moves
 * THAT ref to `origin/<branch>` — the content becomes correct while the checkout
 * stays wrong, and the auto-commit timer would go on committing somewhere that
 * cannot be pushed. Repairing a checkout is a different operation with different
 * risks, so this one does not attempt it; it reports `branchMismatch` instead, which
 * is the honest answer and the one that leads to the right fix.
 *
 * A RESET CAN SUCCEED AND LEAVE THE TREE DIRTY, and that is not a bug in the reset:
 * these repositories contain paths that differ only in case, which Windows cannot
 * represent, so git writes both blobs to one file and reports the loser as modified
 * forever. `findCaseCollisions` names them — the diagnosis is worth more than the
 * operation on the day it happens.
 *
 * Runs under the same exclusion, timer pause and lock recovery as a manual sync (see
 * repositorySync.js) — a reset mid-commit is how a repository ends up in a state
 * neither operation intended.
 *
 * AFTERMATH, worth knowing when reading logs: a reset can rewrite thousands of files
 * in seconds, and the wiki's FileWatcher sees every one of them. Expect a burst of
 * change events, cache invalidation and search re-indexing behind it. That is
 * correct — the documents really did change — but it is why a reset on a large
 * content root is felt by the app for a minute or so afterwards.

 * These repositories are written by workflows that name documents after upstream

 * `checkout`/`reset --hard` writes both blobs to the same path, the last one wins,
 * and git then reports the loser as modified — forever. `reset --hard` cannot fix
 * it, `clean` cannot fix it, and every sync afterwards tries to commit the
 * difference back.
 *
 * Reported rather than repaired, because there is no local repair: no Windows
 * filesystem can hold both files. The fix is upstream — drop one variant from the
 * repository (on a case-sensitive host, or `git rm --cached` the loser and push)
 * and stop the generator emitting names that collide case-insensitively.
 *
 * `ls-files -z` because these names carry spaces, brackets and non-ASCII, which
