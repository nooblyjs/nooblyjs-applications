/**
 * @fileoverview Contain a client-supplied path inside a trusted base directory.
 *
 * The one correct answer to "did this join escape the folder I meant?".
 *
 * WHY NOT `startsWith`. Several handlers guarded a join with
 * `resolved.startsWith(baseDir)`. That is the exact weak form static analysis
 * flags (`datadog/javascript-pathtraversal`), and it is weak for two concrete
 * reasons:
 *
 *   1. NO SEPARATOR BOUNDARY. With `baseDir = /app/json`, the sibling
 *      `/app/json-secret/x` starts with the base string yet is a different
 *      directory. The check passes and the traversal succeeds.
 *   2. IT COMPARES UNNORMALISED STRINGS. A base captured with one separator
 *      style, or a resolved path with a trailing slash, drifts from the string
 *      it is tested against, so the check reads as false where it should be true
 *      (a denial-of-service on legitimate paths) or vice versa.
 *
 * The reliable test is the one `shared/spaces/spacePaths.js` already uses for
 * space-relative document paths: resolve both sides, take `path.relative(base,
 * target)`, and reject when it climbs out (`..` prefix) or is absolute. This
 * module is that test, extracted so every non-space filesystem route can share
 * one implementation instead of hand-rolling the weak form again.
 *
 * SCOPE. This guards the DIRECTORY containment of a path. It does NOT validate a
 * single file NAME's characters — use `fileNaming.sanitizeFileName` for that —
 * nor does it apply space VISIBILITY rules — use `spacePaths.resolveSpacePath`
 * when the base is a space content root.
