/**
 * @fileoverview Turn a user-typed file name into the name that lands on disk —
 * VERBATIM wherever the filesystem allows it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `POST /applications/wiki/api/documents` used to derive the
 * file name from the document title with a URL slug:
 *
 *     title.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-').replace(/^-+|-+$/g, '')
 *
 * That is the right transform for a slug and the wrong one for a file name. It
 * lowercased the name, collapsed spaces to hyphens, and — because a dot is not
 * `[a-z0-9]` — ate the LEADING DOT, so `.Engineering.md` was created as
 * `engineering.md`. A leading dot is load-bearing here: a hidden root-level
 * `.<space>.md` is exactly how the several spaces sharing one content root each
 * keep their own landing page side by side (see `spaceHomeCandidates`), so the
 * slug did not just rename the file, it silently produced a DIFFERENT file that
 * no space resolves as its home.
 *
 * The rule is therefore: honour what the user typed, and reject — loudly — only
 * what a filesystem genuinely cannot store. Never silently rewrite. Anything
 * this module changes without complaint (trimming outer whitespace, appending a
 * missing extension) is either invisible or additive, and the caller gets the
 * final name back so the UI can show it.
 *
 * Note the deliberate asymmetry with slugs: `promptStore.js`, `noteStore.js`
 * and friends still slugify, and should — those names are machine-chosen keys
 * that nobody types or reads back. This module is only for names a person
 * authored.
