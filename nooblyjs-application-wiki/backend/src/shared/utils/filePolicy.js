/**
 * @fileoverview File handling policy — the single source of truth for how each
 * file class is viewed, downloaded and searched.
 *
 * The guiding principle: the uploaded original is always preserved and is always
 * what you download. A *derived* markdown artifact is generated only when the
 * original cannot do a job itself:
 *
 *   - Office (docx/xls/ppt…): can't render in a browser and can't be searched
 *       → view the derived markdown, download the original, search the markdown.
 *   - PDF: renders natively but can't be searched well
 *       → view the original (rendered), download the original, search the markdown.
 *   - Text/code/data: already serves all three jobs in its original form
 *       → view / download / search the original. No derivation.
 *
 * ALL per-document artifacts are stored FOLDER-LOCAL, in a `.system/` directory
 * inside the *same folder* as the document they belong to. Nothing mirrors the
 * space tree from a root namespace:
 *
 *   <folder>/.system/derived/    markdown extracted from a binary the user still
 *                                owns as the primary document — PDFs, office docs
 *                                (`sub/report.pdf` → `sub/.system/derived/report.pdf.md`).
 *                                Feeds the markdown view (office) and search/context.
 *   <folder>/.system/originals/  the untouched source of a document whose markdown
 *                                became the *visible* page — office drops
 *                                (`sub/report.docx` → `sub/.system/originals/report.docx`).
 *                                Served by the `sub/report.md` page's download link.
 *   <folder>/.system/context/    AI-generated context (`sub/report.md` →
 *                                `sub/.system/context/report.md`, plus a
 *                                `_folder.md` roll-up for the folder itself).
 *   <folder>/.system/file-order.json, file-types.json   child ordering + colours.
 *   <folder>/.system/home-seed.json  provenance for a `.home.md` the context build
 *                                seeded, so a rebuild may refresh its own page but
 *                                never a hand-written one (see HOME_SEED_FILE).
 *
 * Keeping these beside their source means the artifacts travel with the content:
 * spaces whose folders are symlinks to separate git repositories keep each repo's
 * derived/context/originals inside that repo, so they are versioned and cloned
 * along with the documents they describe.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — the space root is itself a folder that holds documents. Its
 * `<space>/.system/` therefore serves BOTH roles at once:
 *   • folder-local artifacts for files sitting directly in the space root
 *     (`home.md` → `.system/context/home.md`, `.system/file-order.json`, …), and
 *   • the space-SCOPED sub-folder `useractivity/`, which belongs to the space
 *     rather than to any document.
 * These never collide: the space-scoped names are fixed and distinct from the
 * `derived`/`originals`/`context` artifact folders. Do not read `<space>/.system/
 * derived/` as a tree-mirroring namespace — it holds sidecars for the ROOT's own
 * files only, exactly like any other folder's `.system/derived/`.
 *
 * `templates/` is the one namespace that is BOTH, and deliberately so:
 *
 *   <folder>/.system/templates/  document templates offered when creating a file
 *                                *in or below* that folder. Resolved as a CASCADE
 *                                (`templateDirsFor`) — the target folder first,
 *                                then each ancestor, ending at the space root's
 *                                `.system/templates/`, which is therefore the
 *                                space-wide tier every folder inherits.
 *
 * So the space root's copy is not a different KIND of thing, it is the last stop
 * of the same walk — which is why a folder template of the same name shadows it.
 * The two tiers differ only in who may write them (see `spacePermissions.js`):
 * the root's require a space admin, a folder's require only the right to write
 * that folder.
 *
 * Because the wiki tree builders skip dot-prefixed names (`.system` included),
 * none of these ever surface as their own documents.

 * Every failure mode (missing marker, corrupt JSON, changed line endings) resolves
