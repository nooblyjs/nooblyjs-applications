/**
 * @fileoverview Recent-changes scan — what changed lately in a folder and
 * everything beneath it.
 *
 * Backs the ```` ```recent-changes ```` landing block (parser:
 * MarkdownParser.renderRecentChanges; hydrator: recentChangesController) and
 * `GET /applications/wiki/api/spaces/:spaceId/recent-changes`.
 *
 * THE SOURCE OF TRUTH IS THE FILE SYSTEM, deliberately. The search index also
 * carries a `modifiedTime` per document and scanning it in memory would be
 * free, but that stamp is only as fresh as the last time the file was INDEXED —
 * a boot loads the index from disk without walking, so anything written while
 * the backend was down keeps its old stamp and would silently never appear in a
 * panel whose entire job is to say "this changed". A directory walk is always
 * right. The cost of being always right is paid down by the caller's cache (see
 * filingRoutes' recentEntriesForSpace) and by the two bounds below.
 *
 * BOUNDS. The content roots are directories of symlinked git repositories, so
 * an unbounded recursive walk is the request that never returns (the same
 * reason the folder tree is lazy — see CLAUDE.md). Two guards, and both report
 * themselves rather than failing silently:
 *   - `depthRemaining` stops the recursion at a fixed number of levels;
 *   - `maxDirs` stops it after a fixed number of directory listings.
 * Either one tripping sets `truncated`, which the route passes to the client so
 * a short answer is distinguishable from a quiet one.
 *
 * DOT-PREFIXED NAMES ARE SKIPPED WHOLESALE — `.system` (derived sidecars,
 * context, originals, templates), `.aicontext`, `.home.md`. These are written
 * BY the app, often as a side effect of something else being saved, so a
 * "recent changes" panel that listed them would mostly be reporting on itself.
 * That also matches what the file tree, the search indexer and the file watcher
 * each skip, so a document can never appear here that is invisible everywhere
 * else.
