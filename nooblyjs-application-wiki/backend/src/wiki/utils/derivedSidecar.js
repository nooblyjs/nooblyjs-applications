/**
 * @fileoverview Derived markdown sidecar management — the single place that decides
 * whether a binary document's `.system/derived/<name>.<ext>.md` needs (re)writing,
 * and produces it.
 *
 * The PDF case is the one that matters most. `filePolicy` gives a PDF
 * `{ view: 'original', download: 'original', search: 'markdown' }`: the PDF itself
 * stays the document the wiki shows, links to and downloads, while the sidecar is
 * the ONLY thing that carries its text into the search index. With no sidecar a PDF
 * is findable by file NAME alone — which looks like a working search right up until
 * someone searches for a phrase that lives inside the document.
 *
 * Sidecars used to be written from exactly one place: the file watcher, on add and
 * change. The watcher runs with `ignoreInitial: true`, so a file that was already
 * on disk when the backend started never raises an event — a corpus copied in while
 * the server was down, restored from a backup, bulk-uploaded before this feature
 * existed, or pulled into a folder that symlinks a separate git repo has no sidecars
 * and nothing that would ever create them. Sharing this module between the watcher
 * (event-driven) and the search indexer (repair-on-index) means both routes converge
 * on the same file with the same naming.
 *
 * The sidecar is derived data: it is always safe to delete and regenerate, and it is
 * never the download source — the original is untouched throughout.
