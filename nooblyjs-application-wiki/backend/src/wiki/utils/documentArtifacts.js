/**
 * @fileoverview Folder-local artifact cleanup for a document that has been deleted.
 *
 * Every per-document artifact lives in `<the document's own folder>/.system/`
 * (see `shared/utils/filePolicy.js`, the single source of truth for the layout):
 *
 *   - `.system/derived/<name>.<ext>.md`  the markdown extracted from a binary — the
 *                                        ONLY thing that carries a PDF's text into search;
 *   - `.system/originals/<name>.<ext>`   the untouched office source behind a converted,
 *                                        visible `<name>.md` page;
 *   - `.system/context/<name>[.md]`      the AI context sidecar read by chat grounding
 *                                        and the Context Manager;
 *   - `.system/home-seed.json`           for a `.home.md` only: the marker saying the
 *                                        context build seeded that page.
 *
 * Deleting the document removes none of them, and nothing else ever revisits them:
 * `.system` is in the file watcher's IGNORED_SEGMENT, and the context build only ever
 * writes. Left behind they are not merely clutter:
 *
 *   - a stale derived sidecar keeps answering content searches for a document that no
 *     longer exists — the indexer keys the entry under the ORIGINAL's path, so the hit
 *     opens a 404;
 *   - a stale context sidecar keeps feeding chat grounding a summary of deleted content,
 *     and the next folder roll-up folds that summary straight back in.
 *
 * This module is the single place that maps a deleted document to every artifact it
 * owned and removes them. Best-effort by contract: a missing artifact is the normal
 * case (most documents own none), never an error.
