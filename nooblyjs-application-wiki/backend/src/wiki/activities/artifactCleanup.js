/**
 * @fileoverview Event-bus subscriber that cleans up after a deleted document or folder.
 *
 * Deleting a document leaves three things behind that nothing else ever revisits:
 *
 *   1. its folder-local artifacts — `.system/derived/`, `.system/originals/`,
 *      `.system/context/`, and for a `.home.md` the `.system/home-seed.json` marker
 *      (see utils/documentArtifacts.js for why each one matters);
 *   2. its bullet in the folder's `.system/context/_folder.md` roll-up, and therefore
 *      in the folder's seeded `.home.md`;
 *   3. for a deleted FOLDER, its whole `## Subfolders` section in the PARENT's roll-up.
 *
 * This module closes all three off the event bus, which is the one place every delete
 * converges regardless of how it happened — the file watcher's `unlink`/`unlinkDir`
 * (drag-out, git checkout, a workflow writing to disk) and the wiki's own
 * `DELETE /applications/wiki/api/{documents,folders}/:path` routes both emit here.
 * Subscribing once is what makes the cleanup source-agnostic; doing it inside the
 * watcher's handlers would miss anything the watcher never sees.
 *
 * Both sources firing for the same delete (an API delete also raises the watcher's
 * unlink) is expected and harmless: artifact removal is idempotent, and the two context
 * rebuilds coalesce inside ContextTrigger's per-folder debounce into one job.
