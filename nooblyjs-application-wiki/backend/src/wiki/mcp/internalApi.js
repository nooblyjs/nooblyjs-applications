/**
 * @fileoverview Loopback client for the wiki's own public HTTP API.
 *
 * The MCP tools deliberately go back through HTTP rather than reaching into
 * DataManager / the filing services directly. That is the whole security
 * design: every read then traverses `spacePaths.js` with visibility ON, so a
 * curated-away path answers 404 (never 403), pass-through containers behave,
 * and shared content roots stay curated per space. Bypassing HTTP would mean
 * re-implementing that boundary in a second place — see the shared-content-root
 * guards note in CLAUDE.md for how that went the first time.
 *
 * Three traps this module exists to absorb:
 *
 * 1. **Never call the public hostname.** A self-call to the external URL goes
 *    back through the reverse proxy and the Entra SSO guard, which answers a
 *    302 to the login page rather than data. (Same failure the workflow bridge
 *    hit before it moved to file IPC.) We always target 127.0.0.1.
 *
 * 2. **The loopback port and protocol are read off the live request**, not from
 *    config. `req.socket.localPort` is literally the port this request arrived
 *    on and `req.socket.encrypted` whether it was TLS — so this keeps working
 *    when PORT changes, and under both the HTTP and HTTPS boot paths (app.js
 *    binds HTTPS on PORT and only 301-redirects from the HTTP port, so guessing
 *    `http://127.0.0.1:9101` would silently follow a redirect in production).
 *
 * 3. **TLS verification is off for loopback only.** The HTTPS boot path uses
 *    self-signed certs, and we are talking to ourselves over 127.0.0.1 — there
 *    is no man in the middle to protect against on a loopback socket.
