/**
 * @fileoverview Builds the wiki's MCP server instance and registers its tools.
 *
 * One server is built **per request** (see mount.js) so the tool handlers can
 * close over that request's authenticated API client. That is cheap — building
 * a server is object construction, not I/O — and it means there is no session
 * table mapping MCP connections to users, and therefore nothing to leak between
 * them.
 *
 * The SDK is ESM-only (`"type": "module"`) and this backend is CommonJS, so it
 * is pulled in with a memoised dynamic `import()` rather than `require()`.
