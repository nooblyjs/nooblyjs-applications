/**
 * @fileoverview Server-side visit capture for document READS.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A visit used to be recorded in exactly one place: the browser
 * (and the Chrome extension) calling `POST /applications/wiki/api/user/visit`
 * after a human opened a document. That misses every read that does NOT go
 * through those UIs:
 *
 *   • MCP — `read_document` reads `GET .../file-content/:path` AS THE REAL USER
 *     (their bearer token is forwarded, see mcp/internalApi.js) but never posts a
 *     visit. A person consuming a document through an agent is real usage, and it
 *     was invisible to the tally.
 *   • Any direct API consumer holding a `dtk_` token, likewise.
 *
 * ...while NOT counting the one reader we deliberately want silent:
 *
 *   • The sync daemon mirrors whole spaces through a different route family
 *     entirely — `/services/filing/api/:instance/download/*` — so it never
 *     touches `file-content` and is excluded here BY CONSTRUCTION, not by luck.
 *
 * WHAT THIS RECORDS, AND WHERE. Only the per-day usage TALLY (visitTally.js),
 * never the `recent` list. `recent` is a UI "jump back to what you were reading"
 * feature owned by the browser; letting an MCP/API read push entries into a
 * person's browser jump-list would be wrong. The tally is just counts, so
 * incrementing it from the read path is cheap and is exactly the "how much did
 * they use it" signal the tally was built for.
 *
 * READS ARE ALWAYS 'viewed'. An edit is a distinct explicit action on a
 * different endpoint; reading a document's content is a view by definition.
 *
 * BEST EFFORT, LIKE POST /user/visit. A counter that cannot be written must
 * never fail the read it was counting — every path here swallows its own error
 * and warns, matching userRoutes' visit handler.
 *
 * OPT-OUT. A caller that reads `file-content` for bulk/automation purposes and
 * does NOT want to be counted (a future indexer, a crawler) can send
 * `X-DTK-No-Visit: 1`. There is no opt-out for the daemon because the daemon
 * does not use this endpoint at all.
