/**
 * @fileoverview Per-user notes about a piece of content.
 *
 * A note is a free-text jotting a user keeps against a document or a folder.
 * NOTES ARE CONTENT: they are stored in the SAME FOLDER as the thing they are
 * about, so they are versioned, cloned and reviewed with it.
 *
 *   <content root>/<folder of the noted thing>/.system/useractivity/<prefix>/notes/
 *       <content-title>.txt      the note BODY, and nothing else
 *       <content-title>-2.txt    second note about the same content
 *       <content-title>.webm     the VOICE recording, when the note has one
 *       <content-title>.png      a PICTURE pasted into the note (and -2, -3…)
 *       notes.json               the index for THIS folder's notes
 *
 * FOLDER-LOCAL, NOT SPACE-ROOT. This matches every other per-document artifact
 * (`.system/derived`, `.system/context`, `file-order.json`) and for the same
 * reason: the content roots are directories of symlinked git repositories, so
 * an artifact kept inside the folder it describes is committed and cloned with
 * that repository, while one kept in a space-root namespace is stranded outside
 * it. A note about a document is a note about that repository's content, and
 * travels with it. Note the consequence, which is deliberate: notes reach
 * everyone who clones the repository.
 *
 * THE FOLDER IS DERIVED FROM THE TARGET, never sent by a client — `folderFor`
 * is the single place that decides. A note about a DOCUMENT lands in the
 * document's own folder; a note about a FOLDER lands inside that folder, the
 * same way its `_folder.md` context roll-up does. A note about the space root
 * lands at the root, which is where every note used to live.
 *
 * A CONSEQUENCE FOR CALLERS: an index is per folder, so a note id ALONE no
 * longer says which index holds it, and scanning for one would be the
 * exhaustive tree walk the lazy folder tree exists to avoid. Every function
 * below therefore takes the `target` ({ type, path }) the caller already had in
 * hand — the same rule the Continuous Exploration routes follow for templates.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE .txt PER NOTE PLUS AN INDEX. The body lives in a plain text
 * file so it stays readable, greppable and editable outside the app — which is
 * the whole point of keeping notes as files rather than rows. But a file name
 * cannot carry the association reliably: two documents in different folders
 * share a title, a note has no title of its own, and a title can be re-slugged
 * differently tomorrow. `notes.json` therefore owns the mapping (id → file,
 * target type/path, timestamps) and the .txt owns the words. The index is the
 * only thing that names a file; a client never does, which is also what keeps a
 * crafted id from escaping the notes folder.
 *
 * A VOICE NOTE IS A NOTE WITH A RECORDING ATTACHED, not a second kind of note.
 * The audio sits beside the body under the same stem, so the pair travels
 * together and the folder stays browsable - a recording is a file you can
 * double-click. The `.txt` keeps its job of holding words: a caption typed
 * beside the recording today, a transcript later. Everything else - counting,
 * listing, visibility, deletion - is untouched by the attachment, which is the
 * point of modelling it this way rather than as a parallel artefact.
 *
 * PICTURES WORK THE SAME WAY, with one difference: a note has at most one
 * recording (re-recording replaces it) but any number of pictures, so they are
 * an ARRAY and each carries its own id. What they do NOT do is go into the
 * `.txt` as markdown. The body is plain text on purpose - no markup to parse,
 * nothing to corrupt, editable in Notepad - and turning it into a document
 * format so an image could be referenced from inside it would trade that away
 * for an inline position nobody asked for. Pictures are attachments, listed
 * under the words, in the order they were pasted.
 *
 * LIKE PINS, A NOTE BELONGS TO A PATH — NOT TO A SPACE. Several spaces are
 * views of one content root (see components/userArtifacts.js for the full
 * story), so records carry no `spaceName` stamp: a note follows the user into
 * every view that can see the target, and renaming a space breaks nothing.
 * Scoping is the real visibility matcher, applied by the route.
 *
 * Everything here lives under `.system`, which the file watcher ignores — so
 * writing a note never triggers a re-index or an AI context rebuild.
 *
 * EVERY WRITER TAKES A LOCK ON ITS INDEX (`withIndexLock`). Each mutation is a
 * read-modify-write of the whole index, and two of them interleaving silently
 * drops one side's change: the second reads before the first writes, then
 * overwrites it. That is not hypothetical — it stranded a pasted picture on
 * disk with nothing in the index pointing at it, because a text autosave and an
 * image upload overlapped. Atomic file writes do not help; they prevent a TORN
 * file, not a lost update.
