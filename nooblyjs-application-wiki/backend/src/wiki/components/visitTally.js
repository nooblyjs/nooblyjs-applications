/**
 * @fileoverview Daily visit tally — per user, per content root.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `activity.json`'s `recent` list is the only record of what a
 * person has opened, and it cannot answer "how much did they use the app on the
 * 14th" for two structural reasons:
 *
 *   1. IT IS DEDUPED BY PATH. Opening one document forty times replaces the same
 *      entry forty times and leaves ONE record carrying only the last visit.
 *   2. IT IS CAPPED. `userArtifacts.RECENT_LIMIT` is 50 per content root, so a
 *      busy fortnight silently evicts the fortnight before it — and eviction is
 *      indistinguishable from "they were not here".
 *
 * Both are correct for what `recent` is for (a short "jump back to what you were
 * reading" list). Neither is survivable for a usage chart, where an
 * under-reported day looks exactly like a quiet day. So visits are ALSO counted
 * here, in a file that only ever grows:
 *
 *   <content root>/.system/useractivity/<prefix>/visits.json
 *   { "version": 1, "startedAt": "…", "days": { "2026-09-05": { "viewed": 12, "edited": 2 } } }
 *
 * COUNTS, NOT PATHS. The tally is deliberately just numbers per day. It is read
 * by a backoffice usage screen, so keeping the "what did they read" detail in
 * exactly one place — `recent`, which the user can clear themselves — rather
 * than duplicating it into an append-only file is the conservative choice. It is
 * also what keeps the file small enough to read on every request.
 *
 * DAYS ARE LOCAL. `dayKey` uses the server's local calendar day, because the
 * chart is read by a human in that timezone and a UTC boundary would split their
 * evening across two bars.
 *
 * HISTORY. Tallying starts the first time this module records a visit, so it has
 * nothing to say about the past. `series()` therefore merges in what CAN be
 * inferred from `recent` — see the note there. That gives the chart history on
 * the day this ships, with no migration and no seeding step that could
 * double-count.
