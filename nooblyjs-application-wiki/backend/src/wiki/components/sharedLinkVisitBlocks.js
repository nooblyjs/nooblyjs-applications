/**
 * @fileoverview Inline shared-link-visit block helpers.
 *
 * A document's deep-link audit trail lives inline in its markdown, inside a
 * SINGLE rolling fenced ```SharedLinkVisits``` block at EOF, one line per
 * visit:
 *
 *   ```SharedLinkVisits
 *   2026-07-22T17:43:51.769Z  someone@example.com  (sharedBy: (direct))
 *   2026-07-22T17:45:15.712Z  someone@example.com  (sharedBy: teams)
 *   ```
 *
 * "Single" is the intent, not a guarantee. A wholesale rewrite by a content
 * workflow, a hand edit, or a merge of two checkouts leaves EXTRA blocks
 * behind, and the reader then sees a stack of identical collapsed "Shared
 * link visits" strips instead of one audit trail — while the duplicated
 * entries feed the search index and AI context as noise.
 *
 * So the writer coalesces rather than appends: every block in the document is
 * folded into one at the position of the first, entries de-duplicated on the
 * whole line. Matching is case-insensitive and CRLF-tolerant because these
 * blocks are written by the backend but EDITED by anything (the content roots
 * are Windows git checkouts) — and a block that fails to match is a block that
 * gets duplicated rather than updated, which is the very failure this exists
 * to stop.
 *
 * The render side merges too (`coalesceSharedLinkVisits` in the browser
 * parser): a page must read correctly while duplicates are still on disk, and
 * a document nothing has written to since is never healed here at all.
 *
 * This module is pure (no I/O) so the parsing/mutation logic is unit-testable
 * in isolation — the same shape as components/reviewBlocks.js.
