/**
 * @fileoverview Per-user artefact scoping — pins, recent, starred.
 *
 * THESE ARTEFACTS BELONG TO A PATH, NOT TO A SPACE.
 *
 * They are stored per CONTENT ROOT already: `spaceUserStore` resolves a space
 * to `space.path || configuration.filing.baseDir`, so every space sitting on one
 * root shares one `pins.json` / `activity.json`. Several spaces sharing a root
 * is the normal arrangement now — Engineering, Financial Services, People and
 * Retail are four VIEWS of `knowledge-content/engineering`, differing only by
 * `excludedPaths`.
 *
 * Records used to carry a `spaceName` string and the UI filtered on it. That was
 * wrong in four ways:
 *
 *   1. RENAMING A SPACE ORPHANED EVERYTHING. The stamp was the space's display
 *      name, so a rename made every record invisible with no error — observed
 *      live: four pins and eight recent entries stamped "Engineering
 *      Collaboration Space", a name that no longer existed.
 *   2. ONE FILE BECAME N RECORDS. Pin a document from two views and the dedupe
 *      key (which included the stamp) treated them as different things.
 *   3. THE STAMP WAS OFTEN ARBITRARY. Search results carry whichever space
 *      indexed a path last — index entries are keyed by space-relative path
 *      with no space prefix — so anything derived from search was a coin toss.
 *   4. IT ENFORCED NOTHING. Matching a label is not an access check; a space's
 *      `excludedPaths` were never consulted.
 *
 * So the stamp is dropped on read and never written again. Scoping is now the
 * real visibility matcher (`shared/spaces/spaceVisibility`), which is the same
 * code the folder tree, search and the filing routes use. A pin then follows the
 * user into every view that can see the document, a rename breaks nothing, and
 * an excluded path is genuinely excluded.
 *
 * Legacy records are normalised on READ, so this self-heals with no migration
 * step; the cleaned shape reaches disk the next time the file is written.
