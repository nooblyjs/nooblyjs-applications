/**
 * @fileoverview Per-user activity store.
 *
 * Every per-user artefact (activity, preferences, chat history, pins, the
 * comments/likes/annotations/reviews content index, notification subscriptions
 * and the personal dashboard) lives under a single folder named by the user's
 * email local-part:
 *
 *   <appBaseDir>/.system/useractivity/<prefix>/<file>
 *     activity.json  preferences.json  chathistory.json  pins.json
 *     content.json   subscriptions.json  dashboard.md
 *
 * `prefix` is the email local-part, lowercased and filesystem-sanitised — the
 * same convention the dashboards loader uses (`email.split('@')[0]`). Logged-out
 * activity is keyed under the literal folder `anonymous`.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for that layout; route handlers and
 * components should go through it rather than building paths themselves.
