/**
 * @fileoverview Which files in a workflow group folder hold workflow definitions.
 *
 * A group folder holds the bare `workflow-definition.json` plus any number of
 * `workflow-definition-<suffix>.json` sub-group files. That rule has TWO
 * independent readers and they must agree:
 *
 *   1. `datasources/lib/workflowBridge.js` — the in-process loader that backs
 *      the UI list, manual "Run now" and schedule creation.
 *   2. `backend/configuration/activities/run-workflow.js` — the worker-thread
 *      activity a SCHEDULED run executes. Worker threads get an isolated
 *      service registry with no workflows in it, so the activity cannot ask the
 *      bridge anything and re-reads the definitions off disk itself.
 *
 * They drifted: the activity only ever opened the bare `workflow-definition.json`,
 * so every workflow defined in a suffixed file loaded fine, appeared in the UI
 * and could be scheduled — and then failed at fire time with "not found on
 * disk". It was silent because the two paths only diverge on the scheduled run;
 * clicking Run now on the same workflow succeeded. That covered all nine
 * `Refresh Solution: *` workflows (solution-design/workflow-definition-maintenance.json)
 * and the entire `system-context` group, which has no bare file at all.
 *
 * Hence this module: one definition of the rule, required by both.
