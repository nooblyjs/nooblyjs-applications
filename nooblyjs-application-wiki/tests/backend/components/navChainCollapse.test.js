/**
 * Collapsing single-folder chains in the left nav.
 *
 * A folder that holds nothing but ONE subfolder is not a level of information,
 * it is one level written twice: `Solution Design / Commercial Services` opens
 * onto a single row, `Technology`, which then opens onto four. The nav collapses
 * such a run into ONE row — `Commercial Services › Technology` — standing for
 * the deepest folder reached.
 *
 * The deliberate choice under test is that this is a DISPLAY transform, never an
 * auto-redirect. Auto-navigating off a thin folder traps the back button (Back
 * lands on the rung, which immediately forwards you off it again), silently
 * re-points shared links and pins (path is identity everywhere in this app), and
 * can strand a folder's own home page with no way to open it. Collapsing keeps
 * every real path addressable and merely stops spending a row on a name that
 * carries no choice.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. LAZINESS — `truncated` means NOT LISTED YET, not empty. A truncated
 *      folder can never be judged a single-child rung, or the nav would collapse
 *      a folder that turns out to hold twenty. Collapsing must also never
 *      require a fetch to discover a chain, since walking the content roots
 *      eagerly is the exact cost the lazy tree exists to avoid.
 *   2. SYMMETRY — drilling in past a skipped rung costs one click, so backing
 *      out must too, or the two directions disagree and the user is returned to
 *      a rung the nav never offered them.
 *
 * navigation-core.js is a browser ES module (also consumed by the Teams wiki via
 * the @nav-core alias), so it is evaluated here in a `vm` with the `export`
 * keywords stripped — the same approach spaceHomeResolution.test.js uses.
