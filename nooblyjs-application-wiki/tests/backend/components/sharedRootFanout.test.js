/**
 * @fileoverview Change events and template cascades across a SHARED content root.
 *
 * Both behaviours here were broken by the same assumption — that one directory
 * on disk belongs to one space.
 *
 * EVENTS. The watcher keys its watch list by path, so several spaces on one root
 * collapse to a single entry and the FIRST one became "the" space for every
 * event. Notification topics are `<spaceName>::<type>:<path>`, built from the
 * subscription's space when subscribing and the event's space when publishing,
 * so a subscription made in any other space on that root could never match its
 * own topic: no history, no push, no badge, nothing logged. The same single
 * event was also broadcast to Socket.IO carrying a path the space might curate
 * away. Emitting once per space that can SEE the path fixes both at the source.
 *
 * TEMPLATE CASCADE. The cascade walks a folder's ancestors, so it crosses
 * folders the caller never named — including a pass-through container whose
 * contents the space deliberately hides. Listing leaked each template's name,
 * path and title line out of a hidden subtree.
 *
 * These are pure-logic tests over the same two rules the implementations use;
 * they do not spin up chokidar or Express.
