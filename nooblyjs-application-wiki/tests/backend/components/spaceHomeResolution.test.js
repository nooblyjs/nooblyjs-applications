/**
 * Space landing-page resolution at the ROOT.
 *
 * Four spaces sit on ONE content root: Engineering, Retail, Fintech and
 * People are all rooted at `knowledge-content/engineering`, whose root holds
 * `.engineering.md`, `.retail.md`, `.fintech.md` and `.people.md` side by
 * side. Every one of those files therefore EXISTS for every one of those
 * spaces — nothing 404s — so the only thing that decides which page a space
 * opens is its own configuration, and resolving against the wrong space record
 * produces a confident wrong answer instead of a miss.
 *
 * That is exactly what a race produced: two overlapping space loads, candidates
 * computed for one space and fetched against another, and the Engineering home
 * visibly flipping to Retail's. Two properties keep it fixed:
 *
 *   1. ORDER — the space's own `theme.home` / `home` beats `.home.md` /
 *      `home.md`, and the caller takes the first that exists.
 *   2. PURITY — the rule takes the space as an argument, so a caller can pin
 *      one record for a whole async resolution instead of re-reading mutable
 *      "current space" state between awaits.
 *
 * navigation-core.js is a browser ES module (also consumed by the Teams wiki via
 * the @nav-core alias), so it is evaluated here in a `vm` with the `export`
 * keywords stripped — the same approach landingBlocks.test.js uses for the
 * browser-side parser.
