## Executive Summary

The NooblyJS Wiki Platform v2.0 is a unified, enterprise-grade application that combines workflow automation and knowledge management into a single, seamlessly integrated system. The platform enables organizations to design and execute complex data workflows while maintaining a centralized, searchable wiki with real-time collaboration capabilities.

**Key Promise**: One unified backend serving two powerful applications—workflow automation and knowledge management—with zero data migration from v1.0.

- Inability to execute complex workflows while accessing related documentation

### Solution
A unified platform that:
- Combines workflow automation (datasources) with knowledge management (wiki)
- Runs on a single port with shared infrastructure
- Maintains real-time synchronization across all platforms
- Provides seamless multi-platform access (web, desktop, extensions)
- Enables AI-powered content generation and workflow assistance
