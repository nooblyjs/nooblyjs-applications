/**
 * Onboarding — suggested folders.
 *
 * DERIVED FROM THE LIVE TREE, not hardcoded. The previous version was a static
 * list, and by 2026-08-03 every entry in it was doubly dead: each was stamped
 * `spaceName: "Engineering Collaboration Space"` (a space that had since been
 * renamed) and pointed at `Technology/...` paths that stopped existing when the
 * folders were consolidated. Every chip therefore produced a pin that pointed
 * nowhere and displayed nowhere — and nothing surfaced it, because a hardcoded
 * list cannot notice that the content moved.
 *
 * Suggestions are now the top of the space's own folder tree, which is exactly
 * what a new user wants to bookmark and cannot go stale. Folders come back in
 * tree order, so whatever an admin put first (via `.system/file-order.json`) is
 * suggested first.
 *
 * No `spaceName`: a pin belongs to a PATH. Several spaces are views of one
 * content root, so the space a folder happened to be suggested in is not a
 * property of the bookmark — see the backend's wiki/components/userArtifacts.js.
