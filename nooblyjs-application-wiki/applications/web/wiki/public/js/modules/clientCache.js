/**
 * Client Cache
 *
 * The single source of truth for the wiki's localStorage keyspace, and the
 * client half of the server-driven cache epoch.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The nav trees are cached per space in localStorage (`wiki-tree-*`, written by
 * `navigation-core.createTreeCache`). That cache revalidates itself against the
 * server with `If-None-Match` on every load, so ordinary content changes heal on
 * their own. What it CANNOT heal is a change where the server's ETag stays the
 * same but the client's expectations move — a frontend release that changes the
 * shape the tree is stored in, say. Until now the only fix was asking the user
 * to open devtools and run `window.wikiClearAllCache()`, which does not scale to
 * 1500 people and is destructive besides (it also drops cookies, logging them
 * out, and the onboarding flag, re-prompting the welcome wizard).
 *
 * So the server publishes a `clientCacheVersion` stamp on `GET /api/config`. Each
 * browser records the value it last acted on; when the two differ, it purges and
 * records the new one. An admin bumps the stamp from the Profile screen and every
 * browser cleans itself up on its next load.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT DELETE
 * --------------------------------
 * Keys are declared in explicit TIERS, and a purge only ever removes keys it was
 * told about. This is deliberately an allow-list of what to CLEAR rather than a
 * "wipe everything except…": a key added next month and forgotten here survives,
 * which is the safe direction to fail. Get it backwards and the cost is somebody
 * being shown the welcome wizard again, or losing their chat history, because of
 * a cache fix.
 *
 *   cache — derived, re-fetchable, and the whole point: the space trees.
 *   prefs — user intent (view modes, nav toggles, panel state). Only cleared on
 *           an explicit `cache+prefs` purge, never by an epoch bump.
 *   sticky — never removed by anything here, at any scope. Dismissal records and
 *           the epoch stamp itself. `assertSticky()` re-checks this at delete
 *           time so a typo'd prefix in the tiers above still cannot eat them.
