/**
 * Notes Controller
 *
 * Private, per-user notes about whatever content is on screen — a markdown
 * document, a folder, or a space home page. Notes are personal: nobody else
 * sees them, and they are never part of the document.
 *
 * Two surfaces:
 *
 *   1. THE CHIP. Any view can render `<button data-notes-toggle>` (with an
 *      optional `[data-notes-count]` badge inside) anywhere it likes — the doc
 *      toolbar, a folder's home card, the space home. One delegated click
 *      handler here drives every one of them and `renderChips()` keeps their
 *      counts in step, so views don't own ids, wiring or state. That is what
 *      lets the same control sit in three quite differently-built views.
 *
 *   2. THE PANEL (`#notesPanel`). A docked right sidebar — a grid child, so
 *      opening it reflows the page instead of covering it. It STAYS OPEN across
 *      navigation until the toggle is clicked again (persisted in
 *      localStorage), and re-targets itself as the user moves around.
 *
 * Editing is autosaving, with no Save button: a debounce per note, flushed on
 * blur, on close, on re-target and on pagehide. Saves are single-flight per
 * note with a queued coalesce, so a fast navigation during a slow save cannot
 * drop keystrokes. A brand-new note is a local DRAFT until it has text — the
 * server only ever hears about notes that say something.
 *
 * VOICE NOTES. A note can carry a recording as well as words, made in the
 * browser with MediaRecorder. A recording IS a note — it goes through the same
 * list, the same count and the same delete — so the panel gains one button and
 * one player row rather than a second kind of thing to reason about.
 *
 * PICTURES. Paste one into a note and it is uploaded as an attachment and shown
 * under the words. Two details worth knowing:
 *
 *   - THE PASTE IS ONLY INTERCEPTED INSIDE THE PANEL. A `paste` listener has to
 *     sit on the document to see the event at all, so it checks where the paste
 *     landed and ignores everything outside `#notesPanel` — otherwise copying
 *     an image into the search box or the document editor would silently file
 *     it as a note instead.
 *   - A PICTURE OVER THE SIZE LIMIT IS SCALED DOWN RATHER THAN REFUSED. A
 *     full-screen 4K screenshot goes past 8 MB often enough that refusing it
 *     would read as "pasting pictures doesn't work"; scaling to fit keeps the
 *     paste working and says so in the status line.
 *
 * Clicking a thumbnail opens it in a dialog that zooms, and the zoom is the
 * PARSER'S — the dialog holds a `.kr-image` canvas, so a picture in a note pans
 * and zooms with the same controls as a picture in a document. See
 * `openImageViewer`.
 *
 * Three constraints shape the code below:
 *
 *   - `getUserMedia` needs a SECURE CONTEXT. Over plain http, or inside an
 *     iframe whose `allow` list has no `microphone`, `navigator.mediaDevices`
 *     is undefined rather than throwing, so `canRecord()` gates every entry
 *     point and the buttons stay hidden where recording cannot work.
 *   - MediaRecorder's container is BROWSER-SPECIFIC (webm/opus on Chromium and
 *     Firefox, mp4/aac on Safari) and its header carries NO DURATION — an
 *     <audio> element reports `Infinity` for these files. So the type is probed
 *     rather than assumed, and the length is timed here and sent along.
 *   - The microphone stays live until its tracks are stopped. Every exit path
 *     goes through `releaseMic()`, or the browser leaves a recording indicator
 *     on the tab long after the note was saved.
 *
 * Backend: /applications/wiki/api/notes (see backend/src/wiki/routes/
 * notesRoutes.js). Storage is one .txt per note under the content root's
 * `.system/useractivity/<prefix>/notes/`.
